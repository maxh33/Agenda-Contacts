## Cloning the Repository and Running the Application Locally

To clone the repository, use the following command in your terminal:

```
After cloning the repository, open Visual Studio Code.
Use the `File -> Open Folder` menu item to navigate to the cloned repository and open it.
For a better experience when running the application on your local machine, you can use the Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code.

1. Install the Live Server extension from the Visual Studio Code marketplace.
2. After installation, right-click on the HTML file and select `Open with Live Server`.
3. The application will open in your default web browser, and it will automatically reload whenever you save changes to the files.

**Note:** Live Server is a simple development http server with live reload capability. It's like having a production server on your local machine. It's perfect for development and testing.
